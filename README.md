Hi, I am Steffen, born and raised in east germany,
studied information technology and focused during the early twenties
on Linux Distributions.

Nowadays I put my hands in nearly every which is related to
Embedded Linux devices, especially BSPs and really have fun 
while resolving issues from the bootloader up to the userspace
applications.

Currently, I try to improve my basic programming skills and seeking
for challenges and possibilities to contribute in quality.

Interesting contacts are welcome in private and in business.

Open-source means fun to me, challenges me every day and is a mindset
rather than a fancy buzzword for sales in dedicated service companies.
