Hi, I am Steffen, born and raised in east germany,
studied information technology and focused during the early twenties
on Linux Distributions.

Nowadays I put my hands in nearly everything which is related to
Embedded Linux devices, RTOS, microcontrollers or software in general.


Open-source means fun to me, challenges me every day and is a mindset
rather than a fancy buzzword for sales in dedicated service companies.
